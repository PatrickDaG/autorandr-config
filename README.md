# Welcome to my autorandr config

This is heavily dependent on my specific setup so this repository
most likely has no use for you.

There are three different configurations for all possible combinations
of one extern and one inter monitor.

To deploy use fora:

```bash
pip install fora
fora -v patrick@localhost deploy.py
```
